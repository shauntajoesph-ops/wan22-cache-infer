[TeaCache](https://github.com/LiewFeng/TeaCache) can speedup [FLUX](https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux) 2x without much visual quality degradation, in a training-free manner.  The following image shows the results generated by TeaCache-FLUX with various `rel_l1_thresh` values: 0 (original), 0.25 (1.5x speedup), 0.4 (1.8x speedup), 0.6 (2.0x speedup), and 0.8 (2.25x speedup).

## Installation

```shell
pip install --upgrade diffusers[torch] transformers protobuf tokenizers sentencepiece
```

## Usage

You can modify the `rel_l1_thresh` in line 320 to obtain your desired trade-off between latency and visul quality. For single-gpu inference, you can use the following command:

```bash
python teacache_flux.py
```
