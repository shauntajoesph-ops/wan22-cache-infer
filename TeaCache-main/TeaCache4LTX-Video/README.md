# TeaCache4LTX-Video

[TeaCache](https://github.com/LiewFeng/TeaCache) can speedup [LTX-Video](https://github.com/Lightricks/LTX-Video) 2x without much visual quality degradation, in a training-free manner. The following video presents the videos generated by TeaCache-LTX-Video with various rel_l1_thresh values: 0 (original), 0.03 (1.6x speedup), 0.05 (2.1x speedup).

## ðŸ“ˆ Inference Latency Comparisons on a Single A800


|      LTX-Video-0.9.1       |        TeaCache (0.03)       |    TeaCache (0.05)    | 
|:--------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|         ~32 s              |        ~20 s                 |     ~16 s             | 

## Installation

```shell
pip install --upgrade diffusers[torch] transformers protobuf tokenizers sentencepiece imageio
```

## Usage

You can modify the thresh in line 187 to obtain your desired trade-off between latency and visul quality. For single-gpu inference, you can use the following command:

```bash
python teacache_ltx.py
```
